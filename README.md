Usage
Upon running the application a user is prompted for team members and their information.

The user is prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
Once that information is entered the user is presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building the team.
Upon selecting to add another team member the user is prompted to enter the engineer’s/intern's name, ID, email, and GitHub username/school, then taken back to the menu.
When the user chooses to finish building their team the application stops and an index.HTML file is created.
The HTML file generated displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.

Clicking on a team member's email opens in the user's default email programme.
Clicking on a Github username open the profile in a new tab.
